# YOLO OpenCL Inference Engine (Linux & Windows)

A very light weight inference engine of **tiny-YOLO** object detection system for OpenCL based graphics cards/devices operating in Linux and Windows environments.

## Background
This project has been deveoped to adapt **tiny-YOLO** object detection system for OpenCL enabled hardware and extend the inference engine to support FP16 and INT8 versions of target models in future. The [original implementation based on CUDA](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) is an excellent reference point for someone to get started but both training and inference are tightly coupled there by leaving some room for simplifying inference engine, especially the 'tiny-YOLO' variant. Additionally, support for tiny-YOLO in OpenCL would also be something many folks would be interested in and hence YoloOCLInference is written to detach the inference engine from the training logic and thereby making the engine simple, more focused & optimized towards performance.  

## Key features
1. Achieves run time speeds of **~227 Fps** on GTX 1080 Ti in Linux & **~73 Fps** on AMD RX580.

2. Implemented entirely in C++. No dependency on existing DNN frameworks.
3. Optimizations include 
   * Use of Swap buffers in convolutional layers to clear outputs in activation stages.
   * Addition of two im2col kernels, one each for 3x3 & 1x1 variants
   * Folding batch normalization into convolutional layer output calculations. See http://machinethink.net/blog/object-detection-with-yolo/ 
   * Branched calculations are optimized with fixed number of instructions.
   * Linear activation has been altogether disabled. Output stays untouched once bias is added to GEMM output.
   * Loop unrolling where ever applicable. 
4. Uses [cairo graphics](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/gtkmm/MSWindows) to render overlay of text
5. Small memory footprint(~200MB). 

## Dependencies
1. CMake 3.8.11 (May work with older versions)
2. VC++ 2015 (Windows only)
3. OpenCV 3.3.0 (Windows libraries are in 3rdparty folder)
4. FFMPEG (Windows libraries are in 3rdparty folder. FFMPEG runtime and development libraries dependencies must be met in Ubuntu Linux)
5. Gtkmm (Windows only). Download installer from [here](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win64/gtkmm/2.22/gtkmm-win64-devel-2.22.0-2.exe)
6. NVIDIA Computing tool kit v9.0/AMD APP SDK/Intel OpenCL SDK (OpenCL library references)
7. [CLBLast](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast) - Excellent BLAS library for OpenCL enabled hardware.

## Compilation in Ubuntu Linux
1. Ensure OpenCV is built with GTK+ 2.x and C++11 support. 
2. Ensure Cairo graphics is installed. Follow this [link](https://www.cairographics.org/download/) 
3. Ensure FFMPEG is installed. Runtime libraries can be installed following this [link](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2016/09/install-ffmpeg-3-1-ubuntu-16-04-ppa/).Development libraries must be installed as below.

sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libavutil-dev
	
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. 
	make -j 4

## Compilation in Windows

The 3rdparty folder provides both the runtime and development libraires required for compilation. Cairo runtime dependencies will be met by Gtkmm installation. 

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"
	cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --config Release
	
NOTE: Gtkmm is by default installed into **C:\gtkmm64** folder. If YoloOCLInference complains about unable to load libcairo-2.dll, it is likely that the gtkmm64 binaries are not present on system path. To ensure YoloOCLInference application can load the dependent dlls, it is recommended to add **C:\gtkmm64\bin** to system path environment variable. 	

## Usage

YoloOCLInference supports processing the following input types
* Single image
* Folder containing images
* Video file

An OpenCL device type can be specified using argument **-gpu_type** in case there are multiple devices present on the target machine. The allowed values of **-gpu_type** are **NVIDIA**, **AMD** & **ARM**. 
If unspecified, the default value is assumed to be **AMD**.

Two output options are currently supported
* Displaying the output with detections by setting **-display** argument to 1. In this case, an OpenCV output window with detections will pause for user input before proceeding onto running inference on next frame.
* The overlayed detections can be saved as JPEG images or H.264 AVI video. Set **-save** argument to 1 or 2 accordingly. In this case, the inference output with detections is will be saved to JPEG images or as an AVI file, **InferenceOutput.avi** within **output** directory of the build directory.

Additionally two input arguments **-det_threshold** and **-nms_overlap** are supported that affect the detector output
* **det_threshold** - Controls sensitivity of the detector 
* **nms_overlap**  - Overlap percentage applied to groups of detections during the merge process with in non-maximal suppression (NMS) post processing step. 

If these values are not supplied, then 0.2 & 0.45 are applied by default.

Processing a single image.
 > YoloOCLInference.exe -gpu_type NVIDIA -input image -display <0/1> -save <0/1/2> -det_threshold 0.2 -nms_overlap 0.45
    
Processing a batch of images. Presently, only JPG and PNG images are supported. All images within the folder must be of same resolution (variable resolution is not supported presently).
 > YoloOCLInference.exe -gpu_type NVIDIA -folder folder -display <0/1> -save <0/1/2>

Processing a video.
> YoloOCLInference.exe -gpu_type NVIDIA -video video -display <0/1> -save <0/1/2> -det_threshold 0.2 -nms_overlap 0.45

 examples:  
 > YoloOCLInference.exe -gpu_type NVIDIA -input pedestrians.jpg -display 0 -save 0 -det_threshold 0.2 -nms_overlap 0.45
 
 > YoloOCLInference.exe -gpu_type NVIDIA -folder "C:\Dataset\frames" -display 0 -save 0 -det_threshold 0.2 -nms_overlap 0.45
 
 > YoloOCLInference.exe -gpu_type NVIDIA -video "C:\Dataset\testvideo.mp4" -display 0 -save 0 -det_threshold 0.2 -nms_overlap 0.45
 
If you prefer to let the engine free-flow without any display or saving options, the benchmarks reported here can be reproduced. 
The relvant command in this case would be 

> YoloOCLInference.exe -gpu_type NVIDIA -input pedestrians.jpg -display 0 -save 0 -det_threshold 0.2 -nms_overlap 0.45
 
## Future work
* Display detected objects class names as text overlay.
* Support YUV image input.
